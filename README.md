# ruby_records
A record store management system, built in Ruby, PostgreSQL and Sinatra. 

Available here: http://rubyrecordsapp.herokuapp.com/rubyrecords

This application was my first individual project at CodeClan's 16-week software development course. It allows the user to 
store information about the albums they have in stock, add, update or remove albums, sort albums alphabetically or by 
rating, and view information about albums' artists.

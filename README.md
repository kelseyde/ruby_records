# Ruby Records
A web application for managing a record store, built in Ruby, PostgreSQL and Sinatra.

Available here: http://rubyrecordsapp.herokuapp.com/rubyrecords

This application was my first individual project at CodeClan's 16-week software development course. It has a RESTful API and implements basic CRUD functionality - allowing the user to store information about the albums they have in stock, add, update or remove albums, sort albums alphabetically or by rating, and view information about albums' artists.
